# YouTube Video Downloader with yt-dlp

This is a Python script for downloading YouTube videos using the yt-dlp library. It supports downloading the best available video and audio quality, merging them using ffmpeg, and saving them to your Desktop.

## Features

- Downloads the best video and audio quality from YouTube.
- Merges video and audio using FFmpeg.
- Saves the downloaded files directly to the user's Desktop.
- Simple and user-friendly input for YouTube URLs.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7 or higher**

   - Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **yt-dlp**

   - Install the `yt-dlp` library by running:

     ```bash
     pip install yt-dlp
     ```

3. **FFmpeg**

   - Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/).
   - Extract the FFmpeg folder and ensure the `ffmpeg.exe` file is located in the `bin` directory.
   - Note the path to the `ffmpeg.exe` file (e.g., `C:/Users/yourusername/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe`).

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   - Clone this repository using Git:

   - Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Update the FFmpeg Path**

   - Open the Python script (`youtube_downloader.py`) in a text editor.
   - Update the `ffmpeg_path` variable with the full path to your `ffmpeg.exe` file.

     Example:

     ```python
     ffmpeg_path = r'C:/Users/yourusername/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe'
     ```

3. **Run the Script**

## Key Highlights
